# Signal-Denoising
This project, implemented in MATLAB, demonstrates a signal denoising technique using FIR filters. The system takes a noisy signal as input and applies various filtering methods to effectively remove noise. As a result, the output signal becomes clear and easily distinguishable, improving the overall quality of the original sound, making it more audible and comprehensible
